      <li id="task1">
        In the attached code <code>assignment.js</code>, you find a variable
        that holds a random number between 0 and 1. Write code that shows an
        alert (with any message) when that number is greater than 0.7. Click
        to find out the value. To check again, reload the page, then click
        again. <strong>My code differs from that of the instructor in that I
        alert the user to whether <code>randomNumber</code> is less than 0.7
        as well.</strong>
      </li>
      <li id="task2">
        Create an array of numbers (any numbers of your choice) and loop through
        the array in two different ways - outputting the numbers inside of the
        loop.
      </li>
      <li id="task3">
        Adjust one of the loops from the last task such that it actually starts
        at the end (last element) of the array and loops to the first element.
      </li>
      <li id="task4">
        Create another random number (in a separate constant) and show an alert
        in two different scenarios: Both are greater 0.7 OR at least one of the two is
        NOT greater than 0.2. To check again, reload the page, then click again.
