# Assignment 4.3 Redux

This is a retread of the assignment incorporating elements from the instructor's
solution, yet retaining some of the refinements in my original solution to the
problem.

Additionally, I clearly misunderstood what the instructor meant when he said that
I should loop through an array two different ways. I thought he meant acting upon
the array elements in two different ways.

What he really meant was that I should loop through the array using two different
methods. I have incorporated his version of Step 2 in the assignnment, while at the
same time, retaining some of my changes that refine the output to the console.
