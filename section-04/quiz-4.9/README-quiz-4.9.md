## Questions needing further exploration

### Question 2:

**What does the following loop produce as output?**

```javascript
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 2; i <= 6; i++) {
  sum = sum + i;
}
console.log(sum);
```

For illstration of how this loop works, run this command from the UNIX
terminal window:

```node question-2.js``

### Question 5:

```javascript
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 5; j > 2; j--) {
    sum = j + i;
  }
}
console.log(sum); // ???
```

For illustration of how these nested loops work, run this command from the
UNIX terminal window:

```node question-5.js```
